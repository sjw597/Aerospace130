#Current Progress
(Refer to tickets)

##Database Table Information
The database table information is complete for now unless if anyone wants to add anything.

##Google Maps API and Points
Function to gather filter points are fine, just need to get a good front-end representation of it.  Clinton is currently working on information box and basic responsive text display.
Need people to work on a graphical presentation of the information.

Current working models can be found here:
