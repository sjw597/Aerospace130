#Current Progress

##Database Table Information
Sunny has imported tip and tle tables.  We want the name of each satellite to be on the tip table as well.

##Google Maps API and Points
Function to gather filter points are fine, just need to get a good front-end representation of it.

Current working models can be found here:

http://107.170.221.211/ct_workspace/Aerospace130/googleAPI_demo/index.php#/demo1 (will be altered a lot since it's a working branch)
http://107.170.221.211/master/Aerospace130/googleAPI_demo/index.html (this is stable MASTER, please update this if you update MASTER)

##Account Interfacing

Need to record account location preferences to apply to filtering.  Refer to secure_account_wip branch.

##Overall Design
Not worked on yet
