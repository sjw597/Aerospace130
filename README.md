#Current Progress

##Database Table Information
Sunny has imported tip and tle tables.  We want the name of each satellite to be on the tip table as well.

##Google Maps API and Points
Clinton: I have plotted points on the map and they look really cluttered.  The next thing I will be working on will be filters.
